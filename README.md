Solar Analysis on my solar setup at home

This is a repo for solar data analysis for my 6.6kw panel 5kw inverter.
The objective is to have a better understanding of how the panels are working and make more informed decision on energy consumption.

Data type
monthly solar data with daily record of 'date', 'total daily production', 'total energy purchased', 'total solar feed in' and 'total load'

- total purchased power
- total number of days
- total cost
- total original cost
- total savibng
- average daily saving
- average daily production
- average daily solar consumed
